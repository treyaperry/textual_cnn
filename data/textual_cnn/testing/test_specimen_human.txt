Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing gown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

—Introibo ad altare Dei.

Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful Jesuit!

Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land, and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent toward him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.

Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the parapet. The sea beyond was faintly glittering, a dull grey-green that shifted with each passing moment. Mulligan, noticing Stephen’s expression, lowered the bowl and regarded him with a mixture of mischief and concern.

—My latin’s all right, he said. —Isn’t it?

Stephen did not answer at once. He watched the water plash against the rocks below, feeling the faint tremor of it against the stone. Morning in Dublin always seemed to arrive reluctantly, as though daylight were a kind of obligation rather than a gift.

Mulligan set the bowl down with a clatter.

—The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea, he said, waving a hand at the horizon. —Ah, Dedalus, you have the look of one who has been woken too early for any serious thought.

Stephen looked at him mildly.

—You saved men from drowning, he said.

Mulligan laughed.

—I’m the only one who can. A brave Mulligan indeed! But come, Kinch, the morning is upon us, and with it the duty to fill our stomachs. There’s the milkman, punctual as ever, with the warmth of the cows still upon the cans. We’ll break our fast and then set off. There’s talk of a swim later, if the water doesn’t bite us too hard.

He moved briskly toward the stairway and paused.

—And bring your wit with you, Stephen. It grows thin when you leave it unused.

Stephen followed him slowly. The tower, the clinking metal of the cans, the soft tread of feet against stone—these seemed to Stephen like fragments from a dream that had failed to end properly. He felt the day gathering around him, pressing him gently but firmly toward motion.

Outside, the sun edged higher, pale but insistent. The air carried the faint smell of salt and turf. Mulligan strode ahead, calling out some half-sung chant, while Stephen walked behind, listening to the rhythm of his steps, the murmuring sea, and the unspoken thoughts shifting quietly inside him.
